## LaTeX

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)

> LaTeX ... is a word processor and document markup language. It is distinguished from typical word processors such as Microsoft Office and OpenOffice in that the writer uses plain text as opposed to formatted text, relying on markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document.

Since Microsoft Word sucks, I would suggest using LaTeX.

### Preparation

As a Mac user, I downloaded & installed [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/), and use TexShop, which is installed along with MacTex.

You may use other tools like [TexMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/), or choose your favorite editor/IDE from reference below.

### tl;dr

Read [this tutorial](http://math.bu.edu/people/shane/latex.html) and get it all.

The following are just random notes.

### Basic

* Every LaTeX document has two parts: `preamable` and `body`.
* Preamable declared document's type, specific features and custom commands
* Body is the main content of document.
* `\` tells LaTeX to follow a specific command.
* `%` comments a line

Here we have a simple example:

```latex
\documentclass[UTF8]{ctexart}
\usepackage{fullpage,setspace}

\begin{document}

\doublespacing

% 中文测试
基于\textbf{Javascript}和\textbf{CSS3}的\emph{网页动画}实现比较和优化

\singlespacing

% New paragraph
So one comment about these wonderful paragraphs. In order to take advantage of them, I have to skip an entire line, as I'm sure you've noticed. So just going to the next line will NOT make a new paragraph in LaTex. I'll teach you how to take advantage of this in one of the future lessons.

\end{document}
```

### Packages

* specific ways of adding features to a document
* called in preamable
* `\usepackage{packagename}`
* use 3rd party package in a relative path
* ( when needed ) use commands specialized for package
