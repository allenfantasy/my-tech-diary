## CSS

### Viewport

The following knowledge comes from [Opera's Dev Team](https://dev.opera.com/articles/an-introduction-to-meta-viewport-and-viewport/)

* `width`
* `height`
* `initial-scale`
* `maximum-scale`
* `minimum-scale`
* `user-scalable`: when set to `no`, the user cannot zoom the page

#### Example

Device width, with zoom 2 times big:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=2">
```

#### with Media Queries

You can think of media queries as conditional hooks that trigger different CSS rules to be applied if a defined set of environmental prerequisites are met.

A major caveat is that if we don't set the viewport explicitly in our document, the media query will not be triggered in our mobile browser.

**Hey man, we need an example**

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 360px) {
  img {
    width: 96%;
    background: #000;
  }
}
```

To make the above query effective, the following is required:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
```

Use `max/min-width` media rather than `max/min-device-width`, thus it could handle window resize in PC as well.

#### Media Query II: high-DPI

CSS pixel vs. device pixel

CSS pixel is a relative length unit -- 1 CSS pixel can consist of multiple device pixels.

`device-pixel-ratio`

### Misc

[Support `inline-block` in IE 6 & 7](https://blog.mozilla.org/webdev/2009/02/20/cross-browser-inline-block/)

#### Column

`Columns` module serves to split up an element into multiple columns, and to give further instructions about a few details.

[Browser support](http://caniuse.com/#search=column): >IE10, modern browsers(prefix needed)

**Attributes:**

* [`column-count`](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#column-count)
* [`column-width`](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#column-width)
* `column-gap`: gap between each column
* `column-rule`: be drawn in the middle of the column gap with the endpoints of opposing content edges of the multicol content.

#### Flexbox

The following articles are "must read" if you want to start booming flexbox:

## HTML (a.k.a How To Make Love)

### DOM

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a *programming interface* for HTML and XML documents. It provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods, and it defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the document structure, style and content.

The DOM is a fully object-oriented representation of the web page, and it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.

#### APIs

Here list some common APIs:

* `document.getElementById()`
* `document.getElementsByTagName()`
* `document.getElementsByClassName()`
* `querySelector()`
* `querySelectorAll()`
