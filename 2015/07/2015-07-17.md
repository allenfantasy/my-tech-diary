## SVN

A version control tool. Different from Git (central vs. distributed)

### Structure

By convention, a SVN repository would have 3 folders:

* `/trunk` - the mainstream
* `/branches` - as the name indicates
* `/tags` - milestones

### Commands

command | usage
--------|-------
checkout| copy code from server to local
add| add a file into version control
commit| submit local changes from local (usually trunk) to server
update| pull down latest code from server's repository
delete| delete a file locally
rename| rename a file
revert| abandon all changes to a file (revert back to latest commit)

It's worthwhile to remember several fundamental rules:

* `commit` is a basic unit of changes
* `rename` & `delete` **should be run via svn**. File delete would not be applied to remote server only if you run `svn delete [filename]` and then commit it.
* Be cautious when using `revert` - you may lose your work.

### Tools

In Windows, [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/) is the only option - it's easy and convenient.

* Versions
* Cornerstone
* SmartSVN
* (command line...)

#### colorsvn

For command line users, take a look on `colorsvn`:

```sh
brew install colorsvn
echo "alias svn=colorsvn" >> .zshrc # or .bashrc
```

Take me 1.5 hour and found out it's really a pain in the ass.
