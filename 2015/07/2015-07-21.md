## CSS

Read this post since there's a similar need in work: [Custom checkbox and Radio Buttons with icon fonts](http://www.andwecode.com/custom-checkbox-radio-with-icon-fonts/)

And here are some notes.

### Mystery of `box-shadow`

The following CSS just could not work in Chrome - both failed like the coming screenshot:

```css
input[type=checkbox]:checked + .lbl::before {
  box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05),inset 0px -15px 10px -12px rgba(0,0,0,0.05),15px 10px -12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  -webkit-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05),inset 0px -15px 10px -12px rgba(0,0,0,0.05),15px 10px -12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

DON'T KNOW WHY THE FUCK.

### click: label, input

Most of us know (but, neglect) that when you click the label the radio/checkbox `<input>` would be clicked as well, as long as:

```html
<label><input id=“my_input”></label> <!—- Modern browsers -—>
<label for=“my_input”><input id=“my_input”></label> <!-— IE -—>
```

Check [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/click-input-when-label-clicked/#comment-81235). This is one of the main reason for icon-style radio/checkbox.

### pseudo class

*Pseudo class* is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the element to be selected.

Check [MDN's document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) for all pseudo-classes, here I just list some I am interested.

* `:first-of-type`: find the first `<span>`, first `<div>`, first `<em>` in children. (Same for `:last-of-type`)
* `:nth-of-type(an+b)`: find the `(a * n + b)` child elements (Same for `:nth-last-of-type(an+b)`)
* `:indeterminate`: any `<input type="checkbox">` whose `indeterminate` DOM property is set to `true` by JS. OR `<progress>` (in some browsers).
* `:in-range` && `:out-range`: matches when an element has its value attribute inside the specified *range* limitation for this element. (Usually, `<input>`)
* `:invalid` && `:valid`: any `<input>` or `<form>` element whose content fails / succeeds to validate according to input's type settings.
* `:not(X)`: match all elements not represented by selector X.

And, pay attention to **compatibilities**.

### pseudo elements[TODO]

[All pseudo elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pseudo-elements):

* `::after`
* `::before`
* `::first-letter`
* `::first-line`
* `::selection`
* `::backdrop`

OH, we have CSS2 syntax as well as CSS3 syntax...

## [`<progress>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress)

Seems really fun.
