## JS

### Pop up confirmation before leaving the page.

There are two circumstances:

1. the user click browser's button (back, forward, refresh, F5, ...)
2. the user click any element on the page which may lead to a page leaving.

#### CASE 1: clicking browser's button

One can should know `beforeunload` and `unload` event.

* `beforeunload` is fired when the window, the document and its resources are **about to be** unloaded
* `unload` is fired when the document or a child resource is **being** unloaded. It's fired **after** `beforeunload`.

In handlers for these 2 events, `confirm()`, `open()`, `alert()` has no effect.

In `unload` you can cleanup some shitty things like GC does, but you cannot revert the whole progress (say, leaving the page), while in `beforeunload`, you can:

```js
window.onbeforeunload = function() {
  return "Some warnings / tips to user"; // This string would be displayed on confirm box.
}
```

If using event listeners, the safest code is:

```js
// IE 9+, Chrome, Firefox, Opera
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', function(e) {
  var msg = "Some warnings / tips to user";
  (e || window.event).returnValue = msg;
  return msg;
});
// You may add `addEvent` if <= IE 8 support is needed
```

However, 2 drawbacks MUST be noted:

1. You [cannot control the message in **Firefox**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onbeforeunload#Notes).
2. The confirm box is provided by browser thus the **UI is set**.

#### CASE 2 - click any elements

Just attach events to all needed elements in the page, popup the custom confirm box on `click` event.

```js
// jQuery version
$('a[href=*]').on('click', function(e) {
  popupConfirmBox();
});
```
