## Two Hard Things

### Preface

As my work goes on maintaining legacy codes and developing new features as well, I found the quality of code has much to do with the quality of naming things.

Since a piece of code with good naming could save lots of unnecessary documentations and comments, and bad naming would mislead the maintainers into a miserable path which would end up with curses in front of the keyboard. Or, to explain these obscure names, more unnecessary documentations and comments have been made, which increase the difficulty of the following maintainers.

IMHO, the difficulty of naming things mostly lies in the frequent change of business logic, which are sometimes unpredictable. And these difficulties may never be erased by natural. SO a popular sentence jump out of my mind (when I talk about this with my colleague):

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. -- Phil Karlton

So I would like to elaborate this sentence a bit.

### Cache Invalidation

Another approach is to reduce as much variable declarations as possible, by using a functional programming style: [more readable js without vars](http://www.zcfy.cc/article/339)
