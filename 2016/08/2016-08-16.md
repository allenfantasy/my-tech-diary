## JavaScript

### ASI

ASI is the abbr. of "Automatic semicolon insertion", it's one of JavaScript's most controversial syntactic features.

The following note is quoted from [JavaScript Semicolon Insertion - Everything you need to know](http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons).

> Firstly, a semicolon is optional only where there is a line break, a closing brace or the end of the program...are not optional between statements appearing in the same line.

Question: What about [JS Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) ?

## TODO

* JS Standard
* "Restricted productions"

> In conclusion: Should you omit optional semicolons or not? The answer is a matter of personal perference, but should be made on the basis of informed choice rather than nebulous fears of unknown syntactical traps or nonexistent browser bugs. If you remember the rules given here, you are equipped to make you own choices.

> Whether you omit semicolons or not, you must remember the restricted productions (return, break, continue, throw, and the postfix increment and decrement operators), and you should feel free to use linebreaks everywhere else to improve the readability of your code.
