## CSS

The following would be notes of Reading [Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/performance-organization/)

### Lesson 1 - Performance & Organization

* CSS style structure: [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) / [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) (Scalable and Modular Architecture of CSS) - pick one or mix them and there you could go.
  - OOCSS
    - separate structure from skin
    - separate content from container
* CSS selectors should be:
  - short
  - classes favored
  - have the best `key selector`
  - less ID selector (in fact, it's quite impossible)
* Reuse CSS code
* Minify & Compress Files
  - gzip
  - image compression
* Reduce HTTP Requests
  - combine files
  - sprites

> Browsers will only ever get better at CSS parsing speeds, even mobile ones. You are very unlikely to ever notice slow CSS selectors on a websites ...
