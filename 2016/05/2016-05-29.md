## CSS

The following would be notes of Reading [Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/detailed-css-positioning/)

### Lesson 2 - Detailed Positioning

#### Float

Float's problem:

> parent element lose context of exactly what it contains and collapses when it's children are `floated` [this may go unnoticed easily]

Solutions:

1. Overflow
2. "Clearfix"

##### Overflow

`overflow:auto` would do the trick, but it would cause scrollbars in IE Mac (Edit: also Chrome in Mac). `overflow:hidden` may be better. Set height to 100% would get this work even in IE6.

Be careful because `overflow` could be treated differently by different browsers. Check this [example](http://codepen.io/shayhowe/pen/LgyKv).

##### Clearfix

The most adapted method would be the [Micro Clearfix](http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/) by Nicolas Gallagher. The key is using `:before` and `:after` pseudo-elements on parent element.

#### Position Property

[CSS Positioning 101](http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101) elaborates all details of `position` property.

`normal flow`

> The normal flow of the document is how your elements stack one on top of each other, from the top down, in the order in which they appear in your markup

`block/inline formatting context`

> Boxes in the normal flow belong to a formatting context, which may be block or inline, but not both simultaneously. Block boxes participate in a block formatting context. Inline boxes participate in an inline formatting context.

`position:static` - Default value. Nothing new. Ignore left/right/top/bottom ("offset properties")
`position:relative` - Behave like static, except having their own left/right/top/bottom as position offset. It is still in the "flow", and would not affect other (sibling) elements. It could also creates a coordinate system for child elements.

> A coordinate system is a reference point for offset properties

`position:absolute` - Remove the element from normal flow, and it won't affect or be affected by any other element in the flow. Receive offset properties and create a new coor-system like `relative` do.

P.S: check [this](http://alistapart.com/d/css-positioning-101/example_g.html) to see how to stretch an element using offset properties.

`position:fixed` - Always there.
`position:inherit` - Just inherit the parent's attribute, as the name implies.

#### z-index

* `z-index` would only be valid on relative/absolute/fixed positioned element.
