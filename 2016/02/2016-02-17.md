## Git

In my PR to [detector](https://github.com/hotoo/detector), @hotoo suggested me to combine several commits into one, which I haven't done before.

By using `git rebase -i`, one could easily do the trick.

### `git rebase`

`Rebase` is a main way to integrate changes from one branch into another (the other one is `merge`). It's pretty amazing, I would suggest you to [have a look](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing).

Use `rebase` would change the commit history of your repository, so always remember this rule:

> Do not rebase commits that exist outside your repository.

Unless, you are 100% sure what you are doing - e.g: you are opening a PR and the owner ask you to combine several commits into one (just like me).

### `git rebase -i`

So here's the main course. `-i` means "interactive", which means this option would:

* make a list of the commits which are about to be rebased
* let the user edit that list before rebasing

So by using this command you could split or combine any commits you want, pretty powerful.

The instructions are fully described in these two articles:

* [squashing commits with rebase](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)
* [交互式 rebase](http://git.seyren.com/4_3.html) - Chinese version

### git-svn

I have been always using git before working in YY.Inc, then I switch to SVN since it's the version control tool accepted company-wide.

But as days gone by I found our SVN system has several fallbacks:

1. ONLY thunk - no branches. ( It's a long, sad story )
2.  It's impossible to rollback to last commit. The ONLY way is to ["merge backwards"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/814433/how-do-i-return-to-an-older-version-of-our-code-in-subversion), which is really ugly.
3. I do think two are enough.

Since it would take sometime to switch from SVN to Git (due to some existing deploy system tied to SVN), I had to bear this until I found `git-svn`, which is a super great tool.

Quote from documentation:

> git svn is a simple conduit for changesets between Subversion and Git. It provides a bidirectional flow of changes between a Subversion and a Git repository.

The basic commands of git svn are:

* `git svn clone` - clone an SVN repository into a local git repo.
* `git add` - same as a normal git add
* `git commit` - same as a normal git commit
* `git svn dcommit` - push several "uncommited" commits to SVN server
* `git svn rebase` - somewhat like `git pull`, but it actually pull from SVN server.

Using git svn would be cool because you could now create as many branches as you want to develop "in parallel", but pay attention to managing them:

> It's better to use `rebase` than `merge` to combine branches.

#### With SourceTree

[SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is a super-cool Git GUI client in Mac. And it supports git svn.

## Tricks <= IE8

using some keyword like `throw`, `class` as property would cause IE error in IE8. Reported in [RxJs](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/issues/312)

On IE 6-8 the event model is different.Event listeners are attached with the non-standard `element.attachEvent()` method. In this model, the event object has a `srcElement` property, instead of the `target` property, and it has the same semantics as `event.target`. [Ref](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target)

So when writing event handlers. One should be like this:

```js
function hide(e) {
  // Support IE6-8
  var target = e.target || e.srcElement;
  target.style.visibility = 'hidden';
}
```

[`Array.prototype.map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) is NOT supported in IE6-8. Either using polyfill or not using it.
