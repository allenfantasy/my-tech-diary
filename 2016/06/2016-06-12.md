## CSS

The following are notes of Reading [Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/)

### Lesson 4 - Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design (a.k.a RWD), is about displaying web page content properly in different devices of different sizes

The main concepts in RWD are:

* Flexible Layouts
* Media Queries
* Flexible Media

Besides things above it's worthwhile to know `Viewport`.

#### Flexible Layouts

Define layouts properties (`width`,`height`) in relative size unit like percentage or `em`, thus the layout would maintain it's structure in different screen size.

#### Media Queries

```css
@media all and (max-width: 1024px) {
  /* ... would be applied when width < 1024px */
}
```

* Each media query may include a media type followed by one or more expressions. Common media types include `all`,`screen`,`print`,`tv` and `braille`. [Complete list](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/all-stylesheet-media-types/)
* The default value of media type would be `screen`.
* `and`, `not`, `only`
* The `only` logical operator is a new operator and is not recognized by user agents using the HTML4 algorithm, thus hiding the styles from devices or browsers that don't support media queries.

```css
@media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {
  /* ... would be applied on "portrait" screen */
}
```

* media features
  * `height`,`width`,`device-height`,`device-width` prefixed with `min`/`max`
  * `orientation`. Could be `landscape`/`portrait`
  * `aspect-ratio`,`device-ratio` prefixed with `min`/`max`
  * `device-pixel-ratio` prefixed with `min`/`max` and vendor
  * `resolution` prefixed with `min`/`max`

```css
@media
  only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),
  only screen and (   -moz-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),
  only screen and (     -o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2/1),
  only screen and (        min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),
  only screen and (                min-resolution: 192dpi),
  only screen and (                min-resolution: 2dppx) {
    /** retina styles **/
  }
```

#### Mobile First

Mobile first means:

> using styles target at smaller viewports as the **default styles** for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.

```css
/* Default styles then media queries */
@media screen and (min-width: 400px) { /* ... */ }
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) { /* ... */ }
@media screen and (min-width: 1000px) { /* ... */ }
```

#### Viewport

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
```

This meta tag declare 2 things:

* inform the browser that the width of page's viewport is the width of the current device
* inform the browser that the ratio between the device height and viewport size is 1.
* `document.documentElement.clientWidth/clientHeight` is the viewport's width & height
* `document.documentElement.offsetWidth/Height` is the width & height of `<html>` element. (If in IE, use `document.body.offsetWidth/Height`)

[This article](http://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/viewports.html) [in quirksmode](http://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/viewports2.html) explained viewport elaborately.

P.S: you may read the [Chinese](http://weizhifeng.net/viewports.html) [version](http://weizhifeng.net/viewports2.html) if haunted by the OP.
