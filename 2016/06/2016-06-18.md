## CSS

The following are notes of Reading [Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

### Lesson 7: Transform

#### 2D Transforms

* `translate(X/Y)`, `rotate(X/Y)`, `skew(X/Y)`
* transform could be combined
* A transform is essentially **a 2x2 matrix** which transforms a 2-dim vector to another vector, by multipling. [Note: 3D is the same, excepts adding one more dim]

#### Transform Origin

* the `original point` of the X-Y(-Z) coordinate system.

#### Perspective

> In order for three-dimensional transforms to work the elements need a perspective from which to transform. The perspective for each element can be thought of as a **vanishing point**

The perspective value can be set as none or a length measurement. The none value turns off any perspective, while the length value will set the depth of the perspective.

The higher the value, the intensity is lower.

`perspective-origin`: identifies the coordinates of the vanishing point of a transform. [Example](http://codepen.io/shayhowe/pen/ihjFA)

#### 3D Transforms

* no 3D skew
* `rotate3d`, `scale3d`, `translate3d`, `matrix3d`
* `transform-style: preserve-3d` allows the transformed children elements to appear in their own three-dimensional plane

#### Backface Visibility

Whether or not to show the elements faced away from the screen caused by transform.

* `visible`(default), `hidden`
