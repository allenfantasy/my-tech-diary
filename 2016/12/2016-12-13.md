### Profile2

When using [Profile2](https://www.drupal.org/project/profile2) with [Views](https://www.drupal.org/project/views), there's a very tricky bug that you would find your duplicated items in your view when you use "Relationships" with Profile in the view.

After reading the [documentation](https://www.drupal.org/node/1074296) carefully I found the solution in "For views integration with multiple profile2 types", here it goes:

```
When creating views with multiple profile types, you must create a relationship for each profile type. One relationship mapped to more than one profile type will result in duplicates in your view.
1. Create Profile2 types;
2. Create fields for Profile2 types;
3. Create users and add Profile2 data;
4. Create View (Show:User);
5. Add relationship, (User:Profile) and give the identifier a unique name e.g. 'MainProfile'; IMPORTANT: select a single checkbox for one 'Profile type', e.g. 'Main profile';
6. Add another relationship, (User:Profile) and give the identifier a unique name e.g. 'EducationProfile' and select the appropriate checkbox for 'Profile type', in my case 'Education profile';
7. Add fields to view and select Profile2 field items. Use Relationship dropdown in 'Configure field' to associate w/ correct relationship;

The above comes from comments#71 & #72 at http://drupal.org/node/1114454.
