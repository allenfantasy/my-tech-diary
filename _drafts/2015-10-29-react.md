### React

#### Component LifeCycle

You can attach a `ref` to any element, which allows you to reference the **backing instance** of the component.

LifeCycle:

* Mounting: inserted into DOM
* Updating: re-rendered to determine if DOM should be updated
* Unmounting: removed from DOM

##### Mounting

* `getInitialState()`
* `componentWillMount()` is invoked immediately before mounting occurs - Any setup code
* `componentDidMount()` is invoked immediately after mounting occurs - Do something whenever the view changes

##### Updating [TODO]

##### Unmounting

* `componentWillUnmount()` is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed - Cleanups should go here.

##### Tips

add DOM related JavaScript in `componentDidMount` hook.

### Summary of Lesson 9

* JSX is a syntactic sugar for `React.createElement`
  * Can put virtual DOM created JSX in variables, arrays, or return from function
* Virtual DOM construction should be side-effects free
  * Given the same `this.state` and `this.props`, `render` should calculate the same virtual DOM.
* Parent component passes data to child components using the `this.props` property.
  * Use ES6 destructing to make ur code more concise
* Use `key` to give child components a unique identity so React can reorder them
* use `componentDidMount` to do setup after browser DOM is ready.
* Replace `id` with `ref`
